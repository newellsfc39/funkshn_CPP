# funkshn_CPP
develop function usage with c++
hey, I am getting started in using github and want to create this repository of where I can practice and learn about c++ functions. I'll spread through all the different topics and functions eventually ... and thru all the languages too, once I become more familiar with how to use github, i'll see if and how to include your work too if you'd like to contribute. I'll keep you posted.
